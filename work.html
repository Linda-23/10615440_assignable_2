The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus<small> often</small> requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

<summary>Related tasks include <ins>testing, debugging, maintaining a program's source code</ins>, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practice.</summary>

                <h3>How is it done?</h3>
                Kids will not have to spend hours studying the specifics of coding. Instead, they can use games and apps to help teach them the basics of computer coding. These benefits of learning programming at a young age helps kids to gain advantages in thinking, processing and communicating.
